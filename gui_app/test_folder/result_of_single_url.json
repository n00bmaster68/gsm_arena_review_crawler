{"review": "\"For me as a regular guy who likes to do jogging in the urban city...\" - how many time per day charging your device after these running? For run need GPS, by the why, if you want to track your way. Apple Watch looks great only at commercial. In reallity i think it's a expensive toy. Most probably for children. But too expensive for children too. Garmin is for people which like big travel, trips and etc. For daily usage i guess the best right now is Samsung, maybe Pixel from Google, people syaing they are good. All others is a crap for money which they do not deserved i think. This is my opinion. Apple actually have to big prices, theirs devices do not deserved to cost so many money. Good quality devices right now making a lot of companies, so Apple just taking money for name APPLE. But Apple fans, i think, do not getting i think that, they still think that APPLE is the best, in reality already is many devices which cost less and looks better. Samsung i think is one of it. Some expert and people saying good words about Google's devices too. Huawei is already for users which do not understand that there is other world i think, others chinese companies (Xiaomi and etc.) doing cheap copies i think only. By the way, OnePlus i think is exeption, they realeased smartwatch which some epxert adding in theirs rank like good choice. So there are devices without Apple Watch, just pick up one. I like Samsung, battery do not need charge so often like Apple, but have probably the same or more features, the same of more good quality and price is less."},
