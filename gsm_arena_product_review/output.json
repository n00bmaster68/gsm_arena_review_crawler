{"review": "Honestly I would have preferred this phone to ship with ColorOS instead like it does in China and like all the Oppo phones have. OxygenOS has always been behind."},
{"review": "in global eu version it has esim"},
{"review": "isnt there esim??it is listed on the spec sheet."},
{"review": "Oxygen 14 needs big improvements. On Oneplus 12 If you switch apps and return to web browser (google chrome or similar) there is 1-2 seconds delay for the page to load. If you scroll on system launcher there is 1-2 seconds delay after scrolls which results into software unresponsiveness if you scroll/touch quickly. If you take a photo the processing takes 1-2 seconds longer. If you scroll in settings and need to touch on search menu to write a keyword, there is a delay of 1-2 seconds. Sometimes in google chrome there is stuttering or lag. Not sure how the phone would perform with such software if it did not wear the quickest chipset in the market and 16gb ram.. Also I am not sure how many months OP need to resolve all these annoying bugs. I feel like I use a cheap phone with this software. "},
{"review": "it's 4 OS upgrades and 5 years of security updates"},
{"review": "No eSIM as advertised."},
{"review": "As a proud owner of OnePlus 11 which is loaded with features and power as well as 5 years of OS and security updates, the OnePlus 12 is all of that and more which is saying a lot. I Am sold on OnePlus."},
{"review": "Why does the pictures look different in gallery app and google photos"},
{"review": "Comparing a 2-3 year older software to the most recent colorOS is useless. Obviously ColorOS will be smoother and basically better in every way other than looks (which is completely subjective and can be argued either way)"},
{"review": "For someone that uses oneplus for years the UI might feel good however someone who's coming from a very quick UI, can feel some difference to the worse. "},
{"review": "For me, it's the opposite. After a few years of using oneplus, even the new OxygenOS (now actually ColorOS) seems very smooth to me. The animations are slower, but they look good. And they can be sped up at any time in the developer settings."},
{"review": "I dont see any comment in the review about the smoothness and performance of the software which to my opinion is really poor. Great device but Oxygen 14 looks slow to me with poor responsiveness. High end chipset and 16 giga ram are useless if software is crap"},
{"review": "The bad thing with oneplus is that they are not solving the software issues with their updates. You still see several issues reported by users since Android 12. The oxygen launcher once upon a time was the best in the market and has become really heavy with bloatware and bugs. Users report same to 1+ but constantly ignored. "},
{"review": "The regular Oppo Find x7 allows you to switch between all rear lenses at 4k60fps so would be surprising if the ultra can't do this"},
{"review": "Because of the demand."},
{"review": "Is this possible with any mobile phone? I am using other phones as well and cannot respond on whatsapp or viber calls directly from the buds with any of them and it sounds reasonable."},
{"review": "Yes, you can swap lenses when recording in 4K30 and under. Why curved display? I guess to stay different. There are people who like the look and feel of them.."},
{"review": "Why such a HUGE curved display? Also can the user switch lenses DURING video recording?"},
{"review": "Please tell me I can answer a WhatsApp phone call with bluetooth buds now."},
{"review": "First of all, thanks for your comment, I was wondering if anyone knew the reason and you're the first one with an answer."},
{"review": "I'm confused about master mode, I though \"original photo mode\" had Hasselblad tuning"},
{"review": "Yeah they definitely seemed to have rushed this review out. Missing a lot of details."},
{"review": "The last paragraph about an Iphone 15 plus costing the same in the US is terribly misleading. An Iphone 15 plus starts at $899 for the 128gb model, if you want equivalent storage (although maybe extreme) or just a step up from that you're right at $999-$1199. Not apples to apples at all."},
{"review": "Also add in portrait mode shots! Feels like they rushed this one out a little.."},
{"review": "Any chance we could get an updated camera review now that the master mode has been launched?"},

{"review": "You say tomato, he says tomatho. In the end does a 20.9 really matter as to 19.5.9? Would us plain ole folk out here in the real world really notice. And if that answers no, why does it matter to  you guys? Tomatos taste an awful lot like tomathos"},
{"review": "He meant BBC. I think he's on the wrong forum. God at least I hope. And hope that I'm not on the wrong site"},
{"review": "Scared? How cute."},
{"review": "Oh no.. you misunderstood. Mate, ehere did I compare it with anyother phone or s24 ultra? I am not saying that it is not a great phone, but what would have made it a perfect phone. The flat screen and the overall size is of course a personal preference, but look at all the comments here itself and it is obvious that people prefer bit smaller phones. May be not as small as 6binch but possibly between 6.3 to 6.5 inch. And the curved screen - it is an out dated design in the first place and secondly there are disadvantages for curved screen over flat screen and that includes accidental touch while holding the phone and using media and the exposed edges being more prone to accidental damage."},
{"review": "I kind of like it,but i'll never get a 7 inch heavy brick."},
{"review": "yes keeping a 6.8\" phone in your pocket is a pain. Once you're actually using it though, it's amazing with a big screen. "},
{"review": "BBK is no longer a company. In any case they never made phones. It was just a holding company before it was deregistered. This is therefore not a BBK phone "},
{"review": "I have seen several reviews and camera samples in which I evaluated the camera (especially the wide and night modes) as well as the video recording to be really average for a high-end device. Has the camera output been improved since these recent updates? "},
{"review": "I am looking for a loptop with weight of around 250g for years. You have anything to propose? Lol. Look around almost all 6.70 inches high end devices weigh around 210-230gram. Xiaomi 14 pro, Samsung S24 plus, Vivo x100 pro, Honor Magic pro, iphone 15 pro max and many others..."},
{"review": "bruh I'm FOR BBK phones, I just wish  they released these phones 2-3 months late and had all these bugs fixed because reviews are putting them in a bad spotlight. These reviewers aren't \"real\" reviewers because they just either get paid or \"have to\" do the reviews for clicks, unless they're biased towards it there's no passion or dedication to updating reviews or having a \"trying X phone again\". Only thing people can do nowadays is just toss a coin and choose a phone they want. Reviews aren't helpful anymore."},
{"review": "The device has already had 2 major updates since release including one just for the camera, more to come. Maybe you should test with those updates before criticising the device further"},
{"review": "Every device, every brand can have a flaw. As you said, test when you get them, if there's an issue return for a replacement. Sounds pretty simple to me"},
{"review": "You do know it's lighter than what I assume is your beloved S24 Ultra and unlike that phone feels so much smaller and lighter in hand..."},
{"review": "Let's be serious mate for all you said.."},
{"review": "No buddy, it's not."},
{"review": "I hope OnePlus will release the new Hasselblad app for other models. "},
{"review": "S23 Ultra is more serious phone"},
{"review": "I don't think it's just the demosaiquing algorithm, but AI perfectly applied. "},
{"review": "It would have been a perfect phone if"},
{"review": "This is better than I phone 15 promax "},
{"review": "Should I get this or Samsung s23 ultra ??"},
{"review": "Why must they continue to make phones so slippery. Some of us don't like cases. I'll buy a new phone if I break it"},
{"review": "6.8 is a good size in my opinion...the gripe I have is why curve the screen when tempered glass protectors are impossible to fit to them?  I am struggling to find a curved tempered glass protector for my Xiaomi Mi 11 and I was considering buying this phone but have decided against it solely due to this problem  if anyone has found a solution, I would love to hear about it."},
{"review": "That is why they make a foldable phone. Cheers!"},
{"review": "Very well said and valid point. Anything bigger than 6.5 inches is a difficult brick to handle. Ideal size would be 6.3 to 6.5 inches that has a size less than 150mm x 74mm  to 160mm x 75mm "},
{"review": "Why does the screen keep getting bigger? What good does that do to ease of handling or battery performance? If I want a tab I'll buy a tab. They don't even make functional pockets for women yet. How are we supposed to use this phone? "},
{"review": "Make a smaller phone for Christ sake. 6.8? This is ugly big.  "},
{"review": "It's not wrong.  At least 3 other publications got the same results.  OxygenOS is buggy."},
{"review": "220g!  I AM OUT. laptop?"},
{"review": "BBK does not exist anymore. It is no longer a company since April 2023"},
{"review": "Your Geekbench 6 benchmark results are wrong. Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 cannot score less that 8 Gen 2 and awful Google Tensor. Please fix it"},
{"review": "My Nokia N8 had a small blurry area somewhere in the frame (forgot where), could easily be seen. I didn't return that phone since the blurry area was very small (not like third of the frame like with the Oneplus 12 tele camera)."},
{"review": "In the video \"4K 2160p 30fps (telephoto camera, 3x) - OnePlus 12 low-light video sample\" you can see the internal reflections of the bright headlights floating across the top of the screen."},
{"review": "I love Chinese e waste phones with flashy spec and 3 years of \"updates\" that does almost nothing. I wonder if my city is still in the middle of the ocean on Xiaomi's world clock map."},
{"review": "It's unbelievable that in 2024 there are still such extreme differences when it comes to demosaicing Quad Bayer Sensors. The difference at 2x between the OnePlus 12 and Vivo X100 Pro is huge even though both main cameras deliver the same number of pixels per object."},
{"review": "ahh yeah exactly man, I'm thinking it's a software thing like there have been a few Find X7 Ultra comparisons online but that phone got a huge update for basically everything recently. So I'm guessing Oneplus needs an update too. Vivo got an update for 4k selfie vids. Seems like BBK kind of rushed their products."},
{"review": "Yeah.   And still some ppl doubt exmor T makes difference. "},
{"review": "Yes. "},
{"review": "You are trying to affirm your purchase, I guess. Everyone is missing out because they don't understand, and carriers are not selling it because they are stupid?"},
{"review": "This screen is definitely better than the ones on the Vivo x100 pro and Iqoo 12. Lots of Chinese reviewers have measured the whole screen auto brightness over 1,600. Don't know why there is a discrepency. Maybe it was an early software build on the global version? The x100 pro and Iqoo 12 are using mixed screens from visionox and Boe. The Op12 uses the same screen as the Oppo Find x7 ultra. It's using BOE's latest and best technology "},
{"review": "hey man awesome comment and I agree, honestly I'd have upgraded from my phone to this one if it were 1 year older so I'm holding on for just a year longer. After that it'd be a tough battle between the next IQOO, Oneplus and Vivo's X Pro model haha like these 3 are the current kings I think right alongside Google's spectacular Pixel 7 and 7a. GSM wrote so many positive things but gave this phone a 4.3 and I think they did Oneplus dirty, the Oneplus 11 had 4.4 stars which was a worse phone even in last year's market. This is the best phone for the most people, the S24 stands no chance, the base iPhone might win people over with Apple's processing and the Google Pixel is a solid contender but no telephoto could be a problem. I just think Oneplus could've gone with a brighter display for a lower res like the Vivo X100 Pro or the IQOO 12 but that's about it and low light video stabilisation seems to be a mess but that's about it, everything else is banger. Welcome back Oneplus, now just put the Oneplus 11's hardware onto the next year's R phone and Oneplus would cement itself as the new global GOAT."},
{"review": "In the UK at least the only reason this won't sell is because you can't get it on contract from any mobile providers."},
{"review": "cons to add :"},
{"review": "Yes, technically the sensor from OnePlus Open is way better. "},
{"review": "Vivo's lack of updates and global 4G/5G bands sucks. They are good phones only in China if you don't care about updates."},
{"review": "Compare the OnePlus 12 with Vivo x100 which is better."},
{"review": "So I'm assuming the higher FWC figure that the OnePlus Open LYT-T808 has is technically better than the main camera used in the OnePlus 12?"},
{"review": "That's a really nice piece of information, I appreciate it. I didn't know they had all the numbers listed on their website."},
{"review": "\"They can bump production of oled if necessary\""},
{"review": "I too am not impressed with curved screens at all, if the 12 or 12r had a good flat screen even like my 8t i would definitely have got one or the other but now very undecided, maybe have to change make."},
{"review": "There will still be crazy people who will claim that it is the same sensor or a similar sensor.. Even if it has half the power compared to the LYT-T808.."},
{"review": "I cant really get it , why people complain about android skins..."},
{"review": "Yet many of the major review sites gave lukewarm reviews to the One+ 12 Pro camera performance, and especially to the nighttime performance. GSMA's review of the camera is a bit of an outlier and more positive than most. For the price, most will choose a Pixel, Samsung, or an iPhone. But if all you care about is the fastest chip and want to save a few pennies, then the 1+ may be in the running. But if you wait for three months, the price will probably drop by a lot, because there is little chance that this will sell without major price cuts."},
{"review": "To clarify some things: LYT-T808 sensor frome OnePlus Open is not the same as LYT-808 from OP 12."},
{"review": "Recently, \"Mr. Who's the Boss\" (a popular hardware review channel on YouTube) posted a very enthusiastic review on the One Plus 12 praising the screen, CPU performance, cooling, overall finesse of the OS layer, and battery - with the only caveat being the camera performance that he found good but not outstanding. "},
{"review": "nice spec considering how much can get the CN version and just flash oxygen , supports the network bands aswell, but think I'll wait another year wished they do away from the curved screen, "},
{"review": "Iqoo 12 is a amazing option and with good discount on credit card . Its performance is amazing due to snapdragon gen 3 processor. "},
{"review": "Majority of their sales are surely Nord. "},
{"review": "The One+ is cheaper, but hardly better. I, like most, would choose the Samsung for the camera alone."},
{"review": "I've bought two phones that had lens flaws in the past.  I would always return it also as it would annoy me.  However, I had great difficultly returning one of them as I bought it from  a Xiaomi offline store in China and in order to return it I needed to go to a service center and get them to certify that the phone is faulty (it can't be returned normally once the box is opened unless there is a fault).  This can be very tricky for a lens issue as usually they try to deny it and claim it's normal as the issue is not that noticeable unless you look carefully.  I had to argue for a long time to get them to agree to certify that it was faulty. Luckily for me there was a model on display so I asked the maintenance staff to compare the pictures with the display model and they could see they were different and the display model did not have the blurring on one side of the picture.  I also only buy online too direct from the manufacturer as they all have a 7 days return policy buying online so you can return it without having to get it checked for faults in a service centre.  Lens flaws are actually relatively common and now it's the first thing I check when buying a new phone. "},
{"review": "There's uncertainty about how capable Sharp is in producing IGZO panels at a large scale (i.e. They might face a yield issue), so choosing BOE over Sharp is a much safer move."},
{"review": "wow, it has better vapor chamber than S24 ultra. A flat scr. would be perfect."},
{"review": "The phone is 960 on their website and you'll get some gifts along with it. Overall is better than S24+ which is more expensive."},
{"review": "Igzi is available only in Japan and only for Sharp. Is extremely expensive and very hard to obtain a satisfactory number in production."},
{"review": "You are right if we consider the price range only. The fact is that people out there are comparing between OP12 and S24Ultra, based on the camera performance and the value for money aspec that make S24Ultra overpriced."},
{"review": "Mediocre? Compared to what in the same price range?"},
{"review": "Don't rely to much on what different reviewers say about it."},
{"review": "The 3x zoom camera of their Oneplus 12 has a lens flaw, like decentering or something. It's on the right side of the frame, quite blurry. Can even be seen in 6x zoomed photos."},
{"review": "Other reviews, such as CNETs, are far less excited about the camera quality."},
{"review": "They aren't the only ones."},
{"review": "after the Oneplus 9 series, this is the best phone for the price, the price for getting into the Oneplus family might be higher but that's mostly due to a starting storage of 256 GB. That's quite the feat. I still remember being blown away by the Oneplus 8 and it was $699 for 128 GB storage, the Oneplus 12 is $799 for 256 GB storage, a sizeable but understandable uplift in price, especially taking inflation into account. This has upgraded speakers, cameras and display compared to the Oneplus 11, this is a killer phone right now. If you're really bothered about the price then why don't you take a look at the Oneplus 12R? Their R series is criminally underrated and overlooked. These phones give flagship performance for a good price, flagship killers basically. Would you really have a problem with having the SD 8 Gen 2 instead of SD 8 Gen 3? Most likely not, that's why the 12R is such a huge win imo. These phones aren't necessarily cheap but phones aren't cheap now and these are offering good value in this horribly priced market. The IQOO 12 is a better buy for me though, for as much flak IQOO phones get, they are the ones carrying Oneplus's past \"flagship killer\" spirit. Xiaomi phones are great and all but uh yk, they're Xiaomi, software is good now but others have great software so Poco phones aren't up to par. "},
{"review": "Curved screen. When will they stop this nonsense? More likely to break, more expensive replacements, and they make the phone harder to pick up and easier to drop."},
{"review": "Why are your Geekbench scores so low compared to other sites that have tested the phone? "},
{"review": "How to fix: "},
{"review": "Considering they don't drop the price, it's not cheap."},
{"review": "The Green fake marble glitter colour is quite ugly, wish it was solid Green like 11. Maybe it looks better it person. White is the best colour and global markets don’t get it!"},
{"review": "From vietnam, I have used oneplus 12 for 3 week. I buy with the price 650$. Camera is good, especially portrait. Oxygen os is quite so so. It's better than oneplus 11"},
{"review": "All in all, a really mediocre device for 1000€ in Europe."},
{"review": "They did their usual stress test... it was nothing special"},
{"review": "There is no competition at their price range"},
{"review": "As other have said the review is a bit dry.. the software side of the review completely missed the X7 chipset inside the smartphone that helps with gaming/ GPU "},
{"review": "That's a Chinese phone though with a pretty useless 2x telephoto with poor quality sensor and no OIS that is not much better than a 2x crop from the main sensor. The ultrawide is also using a very old omnivision sensor that was used as far back as the k30 pro four years ago. Also, if importing to Europe the k70 pro doesn't support key European bands so it's not a great option for Europe. You could also make the same argument for importing the Oneplus 12 for much cheaper if you really want and the Chinese Oneplus 12 supports all European bands so the signal would be more stable. In fact if you want to import you have loads of options. The global price is not cheap but it is competitive and in line with other brands like Xiaomi and Samsung "},
{"review": "🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨"},
{"review": "Excuse me, GSMArena, I like to remind you:"},
{"review": "Open and Xperia also are 1.12 micron. Not OP11,  890/766 are 1.0."},

{"review": "At most gonna mention values of shutter and iso possible. "},
{"review": "$799 is quite good though."},
{"review": "Half the price, half the cameras, half the display. Surely you can't get a phone at this level with $400."},
{"review": "My buddy is blind 💀"},
{"review": "There is no 'real water resistance'. It's only non-water resistant, or water-resistant, which this phone is (IPX5)"},
{"review": "It's honestly a work of art."},
{"review": "Just because OP12's main sensor's pixel pitch matches the one on OP11, that doesn't mean it's been confirmed that they are using the sensor with the same resolution as the predecessor, too."},
{"review": "who fooling  who"},
{"review": "Pixel pitch of 1.12 matches 789 and 888. "},
{"review": "I dont think everything else is on top."},
{"review": "Welp, just another large heavy phone. Boring."},
{"review": "You could have tested it longer, we would appreciate a more detailed review even later than this fast-fermented review..."},
{"review": "Yeah, GSMArena not mentioning the Master Mode is definitely disappointing. I hope they will add it later and include one for an upcoming Find X7 Ultra review as well."},
{"review": "GSMArena, will you be uploading portrait mode samples as well as the test shots in the studio comparison tool? "},
{"review": "What a half baked review @gsmaena? Where is portrait camera samples and most importantly where is Photo compare tool ? I wanted to compare camera quality with pixel 8 and galaxy s24."},
{"review": "So you missed the point they clearly told that same camera setup in other models are already reviewed so why should they do it again if its totally same what earlier models use?"},
{"review": "The review dosent seem to mention the connectivity. The lte fdd band in 12 has dropped a lot of bands support compared to op11. Obviously cost cutting i guess. And in review how it's going to give quality call quality. And support for esim option is not covered. "},
{"review": "yeah I know but it still kinda stings considering the fact that apart from Samsung, everyone is reluctant to drop prices so for every other brand what you see is what you have to pay. Like, if this phone were 800 euros or something that'd have made this a killer flagship, the main gripe I have is with the display, 100-200 USD less is necessary for a cut down display like this."},
{"review": "Was hoping for a bit more detail on the camera review.  It is way shorter than normal and omits many usual things.  No portraits, and no information about the master mode where you can adjust things like photo sharpness and no photos or videos in the photo/video compare tool.  "},
{"review": "Oh, it seems the pricing varies according to the country. It also seems that the shittier the country, the more expensive the phone is. In my countrry the difference between top versions of 11 and 12 is 149eur. I'll pass"},
{"review": "Yep. Also that's the reason why Sony's current highest-end mobile sensor, IMX989, uses dual pixel (2x1 OCL), not 2x2 OCL."},
{"review": "We'll have to wait for either a confirmation from OnePlus (that they use the same 52MP multi-aspect sensor) or a review that provides a RAW file from this phone to say if the photos have been upscaled or not. After all, OnePlus advertises that OP12's main camera uses a 50MP sensor and that's the only official information we have right now."},
{"review": "Damn. 1100€ for the green version. My immediate thought was \"that's too much\" 😄"},
{"review": "Tom's also got an unusually low score with Geekbench"},
{"review": "I have the same question, too😂⁉️"},
{"review": "It’s so funny, charging speed has nothing to do with battery life!"},
{"review": "Only certain lucky markets got a free case in the box, it wouldn't surprise me if OnePlus follows in the footsteps of most phone manufacturers with no charger no preinstalled screen protector no nothing in the box. As long as their phones are cheaper than the competition that's the most important thing I suppose."},

{"review": "Yeah, the 50MP mode on Oppo is still a simple upscale from 12.5MP resolution, unfortunately. 2x shots are a proper centre crop from the full resolution so it's technically still 12.5MP, but because of the 2x2 OCL design of the sensors they use, the level of detail is very low and suffers from a lot of wormy artifacts (Commonly seen on many phones that use IMX766 that also has 2x2 OCL)."},
{"review": "Expected better results in the camera, why would they put a quad bayer 32mp in a 1k phone ? even samsung mid rangers have better sensors. "},
{"review": "Yes, last year's 256gb version had more ram. It was 919 euro though at launch based on the official Oneplus launch price (not current prices). For example, in larger European countries like Spain, Italy and France that was last year's launch price on the Oneplus website. Of course it's possible that in some European countries they could have charged a different price but that was the official European launch price they quoted at the launch last year "},

{"review": "You cant really compare them like that. When op11 16/256 came out it was 899eur, it was the \"top\"version. There was no 512gb variant.  Op12 12/256 is 1049 right now and it is the \"top\" version. There is no 16gb version. Different ram/storage options. Compare the 2 \"top\" models, that is 149eur difference and not 30."},
{"review": "The display's abysmally low brightness (for being a flagship category phone) is a huge con. Arguably a far greater sin than the IP65 rating, most people splash water on their phones or spill water on it more than they drown that thing. Besides, the IP rating is for clean water, not salt water, swimming pools or even contaminated drainage water, so it won't help much in those situations. What would've helped tho is a brighter display, seriously Oneplus? Dolby Vision and LTPO4 are THAT important to you? Who cares about that when the phone can't reach at least 1300 nits in 2024. I'm not saying it's dim but it should've been much better for what they promised and additionally, Realme and Vivo have so much better displays, those make this phone look cheap in comparison, especially the Iqoo 12 which is a tier below the Oneplus in pricing but reaches 1400 nits. The jump from 1200 to 1400 nits is more noticeable than the jump from FHD+ to QHD+ on this tiny ahh screen."},

{"review": "LOL, what a joke. It costs 150€ more than than op11 when it came out. Where is that guy @justasmile: \"the screen is cheaper to make so the phone will cost less\". Right, ever heard of corporate greed? Lower manufacturing cost results only in increased profit for the company, it never translates to lower cost of the product. What a naive guy, will never learn"},

{"review": "The pricing is not much different than the previous generation at least in Europe. As far as I remember the Oneplus 11 launched at €919 for the 256gb variant versus €949 this year. That's not a very big difference considering the updated cameras, wireless charging, new USB version and better screen. "},
{"review": "Because it's the same price and maybe the S24 could be more expensive. What is there to defend about the S24 being average because it is compact? "},
