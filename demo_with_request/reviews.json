After that it'd be a tough battle between the next IQOO, Oneplus and Vivo's X Pro model haha like these 3 are the current kings I think right alongside Google's spectacular Pixel 7 and 7a. GSM wrote so many positive things but gave this phone a 4.3 and I think they did Oneplus dirty, the Oneplus 11 had 4.4 stars which was a worse phone even in last year's market. This is the best phone for the most people, the S24 stands no chance, the base iPhone might win people over with Apple's processing and the Google Pixel is a solid contender but no telephoto could be a problem. I just think Oneplus could've gone with a brighter display for a lower res like the Vivo X100 Pro or the IQOO 12 but that's about it and low light video stabilisation seems to be a mess but that's about it, everything else is banger. Welcome back Oneplus, now just put the Oneplus 11's hardware onto the next year's R phone and Oneplus would cement itself as the new global GOAT.",
    "Anonymous, 25 Jan 2024Yet many of the major review sites gave lukewarm reviews to the One+ 12 Pro camera performance... moreIn the UK at least the only reason this won't sell is because you can't get it on contract from any mobile providers. \r\nBut let's be serious, you're wrong with what you say. For this money specifically, nobody is going to buy Samsung or Apple devices because they quite simply do not exist in the same price range and where they might come close, specs are substantially lower.\n \r\nThose who choose Apple will always choose Apple, it has nothing to do with anything other than the perceived value that device has to them which is more than fine. Value for money is irrelevant and I respect that even though I choose not to use Apple devices.\n \r\nFor Android owners the only Samsung device that should really  be considered ahead of this is The S24 Ultra because again, the others in there range can't compete in most areas.\n \r\nIt's a shame because from my time with the OnePlus 12 this is truly an amazing device, curved screen and all. Flat screens these days are no better and create devices which are far more angular and less comfortable to hold by any metric, especially one handed.\n \r\nThe OnePlus 12 is comfortable to hold, more.responsive than any other device I've had the pleasure to use and looks truly stunning. But nobody is ever going to understand that if they're too closed minded to give one a go. Again such a shame that mobile providers won't be carrying this device, as just holding in your hand would turn the heads of many prospective users, and that's just not going to happen as the opportunity doesn't exist.\n \r\nCameras may be less than some of the competition but sorry to disappoint you here, there actually pretty damn good, and when you're saving over 400 bucks on your device compared to the competition that's understandable. The only thing I will accept as a valid reason for not considering the device however is the lack of IP 68 protection reverting to IP 65. To be fair, the way this works, companies like OnePlus tell independent testers to check for conformity to a specific standard, and if they meet the requirements that rating is given. Yes it costs more to Get an IP 68 rating per device but OnePlus has demonstrated again and again that there devices are better than there IP rating would have you think, unfortunately given that they don\"t guarantee against water damage and it still invalidates warranties, it makes it harder to follow that logic.\n \r\nThen again water damage invalidates Samsung warranties also so maybe what we should really be looking at is companies having enough self belief in there product to back it up and unfortunately no manufacturer presently has the balls to do that, IP 68 or not.\n \r\nAt the end of the day, this phone absolutely rocks, and although some diehard Oneplus fans might prefer the old Oxygen OS, having used both that and the new ColorOS adjusted version I truly believe this is an upgrade on the softwaremfromt also.",

    "Recently, \"Mr. Who's the Boss\" (a popular hardware review channel on YouTube) posted a very enthusiastic review on the One Plus 12 praising the screen, CPU performance, cooling, overall finesse of the OS layer, and battery - with the only caveat being the camera performance that he found good but not outstanding.  \r\nAccording to this reviewer, he puts the Oppo 12 among the potential top 3 smartphones of 2024. \n \r\nSo, the overall tone of the gsmarena review is a bit more careful and a little bit sceptical when compared with that other review. The overall rating of 4.3 stars is certainly less than what other flagship phones get.\n \r\nWhile  there is no doubt that this is a hugely attractive phone, I am still wondering how it may compare in real life to the usual flagships from Samsung, Apple, Sony, Asus, or Vivo.",

I would always return it also as it would annoy me.  However, I had great difficultly returning one of them as I bought it from  a Xiaomi offline store in China and in order to return it I needed to go to a service center and get them to certify that the phone is faulty (it can't be returned normally once the box is opened unless there is a fault).  This can be very tricky for a lens issue as usually they try to deny it and claim it's normal as the issue is not that noticeable unless you look carefully.  I had to argue for a long time to get them to agree to certify that it was faulty. Luckily for me there was a model on display so I asked the maintenance staff to compare the pictures with the display model and they could see they were different and the display model did not have the blurring on one side of the picture.  I also only buy online too direct from the manufacturer as they all have a 7 days return policy buying online so you can return it without having to get it checked for faults in a service centre.  Lens flaws are actually relatively common and now it's the first thing I check when buying a new phone. ",

That's quite the feat. I still remember being blown away by the Oneplus 8 and it was $699 for 128 GB storage, the Oneplus 12 is $799 for 256 GB storage, a sizeable but understandable uplift in price, especially taking inflation into account. This has upgraded speakers, cameras and display compared to the Oneplus 11, this is a killer phone right now. If you're really bothered about the price then why don't you take a look at the Oneplus 12R? Their R series is criminally underrated and overlooked. These phones give flagship performance for a good price, flagship killers basically. Would you really have a problem with having the SD 8 Gen 2 instead of SD 8 Gen 3? Most likely not, that's why the 12R is such a huge win imo. These phones aren't necessarily cheap but phones aren't cheap now and these are offering good value in this horribly priced market. The IQOO 12 is a better buy for me though, for as much flak IQOO phones get, they are the ones carrying Oneplus's past \"flagship killer\" spirit.

    "The display's abysmally low brightness (for being a flagship category phone) is a huge con. Arguably a far greater sin than the IP65 rating, most people splash water on their phones or spill water on it more than they drown that thing. Besides, the IP rating is for clean water, not salt water, swimming pools or even contaminated drainage water, so it won't help much in those situations. What would've helped tho is a brighter display, seriously Oneplus? Dolby Vision and LTPO4 are THAT important to you? Who cares about that when the phone can't reach at least 1300 nits in 2024. I'm not saying it's dim but it should've been much better for what they promised and additionally, Realme and Vivo have so much better displays, those make this phone look cheap in comparison, especially the Iqoo 12 which is a tier below the Oneplus in pricing but reaches 1400 nits. The jump from 1200 to 1400 nits is more noticeable than the jump from FHD+ to QHD+ on this tiny ahh screen.\n \r\nThe speakers are worse than the Vivo X100 Pro and quite boomy overall. Worse than even Realme's GT5 Pro, it seems only Vivo has been able to craft really good speakers in the BBK, I think bass is cool and I love it but proper dynamics/less pumping and a good midrange/treble are more important since those are more audible.\n \r\nThe battery is a hit and a miss sort of, the gaming performance is subpar but the web browsing and video playback are close to class leading, I wonder what Oneplus and Oppo do that Vivo, Samsung, etc. don't that makes the gaming battery life so much worse? If the gaming time went up to 8 hours this'd be an extremely well rounded battery phone, charging superbly fast and still having loads of SOT.\n \r\nThe performance is my final ick, even if I were to believe that the performance is going to be better for the CPU (which im pretty sure will be true), the thermals aren't promising. The main culprit seems to be the SD 8 Gen 3 which is just as bad as the 8 Gen 1 for gpu at least, it's horrible for thermals. As days go by, I have more and more respect for Vivo's optmisation and cooling, I thought it was the case for the X90 series (after seeing golden reviewers reviews) and the phones this year just confirmed it, Vivo is BBK's king of cooling and squeezing out performance for the same heat. The IQOO 12 and the X100 Pro are better than the ROG Phone 8 in terms of passive cooling. Now either that's a great achievement or it shows Asus's downfall in quality. For how much flak the Dimensity 9300 got (admittedly I too was skeptical) the chip just seems more and more awesome as days go by. Apart from the ISP, I don't think at all that the chipset is a \"cheaper\" one than Qualcomm's one. Sustained performance matters more than peak and both are quite close between the SD 8 Gen 3 and the D 9300. I think there should be more tiers for the performance mode, as it stands the phones are good at dissipating heat in the current performance modes and a higher tier mode would be appreciated to squeeze out more performance at the cost of thermals. Of course, the current tier should be kept as well for people who don't want the best performance but also not the worst. So basically, I think the performance is more of a current gen Qualcomm problem than Oneplus's so I can let this slide.\n \r\nThe saving grace for this phone are the cameras, but only for photography and even then it's all due to Oppo lmao, the processing is superb. The S24 doesn't stand a chance against this now, better sensors across the board with supremely good processing now. The fact that GSM has to compare this phone's cameras to the X100 Pro and the Find X7 Ultra to show its weaknesses is a huge compliment actually, the X100 Pro's huge sensor is just too good, if OP 12's aperture were f/1.4 maybe it could've been closer. Additionally the Find X7 Ultra is just too good for a phone, huge-ish sensor (for a telephoto at least) and 6x native zoom combined with the banger processing is a recipe for success. The 6x photos are good at night and day, nothing crazy but good photos that are usable. UW cam is good now as well. Good job Oneplus and Oppo.\n \r\nBasically, think this phone's main shortcomings are the display, videography and the speakers for now. Videography ain't bad but it's not amazing, it's good tho at least and I'm content with that. The display is NOT as good as the competitors even from BBK themselves, QHD+ sounds cool on paper but 1400 nits look better irl, especially in very sunny conditions. The speakers should've been more clearer, better treble was necessary instead of more bass and for the loudness it provides, the dynamics are poor, everything sounds pump-ey or compressed and that's made worse by the fact that only Oneplus has this quality, Realme and Vivo provide far better sound quality, Vivo provides clarity and Realme provides the similar bass-ey sound but with better dynamics. A shame but it isn't THAT bad. The cameras are great, the battery is only adequate for gamers and great for everyone else, charging is superb, design is cool due to awesome colors. The pricing should've been a bit cheaper though, 50-100 euros cheaper would've made this far more compelling, considering the huge display shortcomings, the Xiaomi 13T pro had a similar brightness to the display too and that's a compelling argument but Vivo's IQOO 12 and the Realme GT5 Pro having so much higher brightness just makes this phone feel less desirable. I hope this is a software thing and it gets better later with an update fix or something but as it stands I think this phone is 7.5/10, a good phone that's close to being very good but not quite. The better display from IQOO or even Realme would've comfortably made this an 9/10 and better speakers would've made this an absolutely perfect 10/10 phone, even for it's relatively high price. Unfortunately life sucks and this phone isn't that great, would've upgraded from my S22U to this phone if it had a better display but as it stands I'm gonna be downgrading from 1280 nits to 1160 nits. Not a great deal due to that, cameras are better though in photography, videography may be better on the S22 U not sure, its grain makes me stay away from taking videos anyways lmao",
